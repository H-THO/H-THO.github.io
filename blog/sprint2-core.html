        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I studied Ecology as an undergraduate, and then became involved with fisheries work. I began my journey down this path as a Fisheries Observer, taking at sea contracts to collect environmental & biological data aboard commercial fishing boats in NZ waters. 
        After this I worked managing data collected by observers and undertaing research voyages with one of NZ's Crown Research Institutes. It took me around most of the coastline of this beautiful country, altough I did spend most of my time behind a desk in Auckland's viaduct.
        I'm here because I wish to grow my technical & problem solving abilities, induldge a bit more of my creative side, and pick up a skill that will hopefully allow me to employ some of my values as a key compenent of the work that I do.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Skill Development</h3>
        <p>
        During this course I hope to grow my abilities as a team member - working with others in the past has always been an opportunity for growth or reflection.
        Hopefully I'll get to more deeply understand my own learning style, and how this compares to others. I think this will enable me to reflect on my performance and more 
        effectively manage my strengths & limitations - hopefully getting the most of my better traits, while remaining mindful of those that could hamper me. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>A few of my strengths:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I'm adaptable, flexible and used to working in unconventional environments.</li>
        <li>I'm friendly, approachable and actively enjoy helping others where I can.</li>
        <li>I'm conscientious, and (I like to think) emotionally aware in social situations.</li>
        <li>I try to be an honest & empathetic person at all times.</li>
        <li>I'm a big believer in tea/coffee breaks, and can make a pretty good Mojito if things are that bad.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>A few weaknesses I can see:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I can get sometimes a little too focused in on specific problems to fix, and lose a bit of pragmatic oversight.</li>
        <li>I can be a little shy at times and sometimes feel unwilling to push myself into the spotlight even if I have an issue with something (trying a little too hard not to rock the boat!).</li>
        <li>I have a terrible sleep pattern that is constantly reset when working night shifts!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Commitment to manage workload</h3>
        <p>So, while keeping in mind those points above, I have come up with a few things that I believe will be the keys to success.:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Remember to step my focus back 'up' a level or two - am I getting bogged down by details, or trying to be a perfectionist unnecessarily? </li>
        <li>I will make sure to make good choices and reinforce good habits with sleep hygiene and screen time!</li>
        <li>I will not be taking on any more cover shifts at work while doing this course (A hard no from me!)</li>
        <li>I will actively participate in the group and take an interest in discussions of teamwork, decision making and consensus</li>
        <li>I will actively consider how my decisions and actions may impact other team members and staff.</li>
        <li>I will actively engage with my own learning journey and reference back to my intiial aims to guide how I manage this moving forward.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Commitment to seeking help</h3>
        <p>I will seek to get help when I am unable to unblock myself using problem solving approaches and exhausted my ability to research around the issue.</p>
        <p>I will seek to get help if I was to feel overwhelmed by the workload, or if personal circustances inhibited my apply to actively complete the work in given timeframes.</p>
        <p>I will do this before things get to a crisis point!</p>
        
        <h3>Expectations of the facilitators</h3>
        <p>My expectations of the facilitators is that they remain able to liaise with us to help work through technical or cultural issues with out coursework.</p>
        <p>I expect the facilitators to be honest and realistic about my contributions, and to assisst my growth by highlighting issues relating to work or behaviour.</p>
        <p>I expect the facilitators to share their knowledge and help me to develop an idea about where my strengths/limitations could assist or hamper me in the course, and for my future career.</p>
        
        <h3>Block out times</h3>
        <p>I currently work late night shifts once or twice a week. During the Boot Camp course I will not be working at all thankfully!
        My only ongoing commitment is for Muay Thai training, which I have from 5:30PM on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays.
