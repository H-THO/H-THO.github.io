<h1> Values, Identity and Strengths</h1>
<h2>Kia Ora,</h2>
<p>I'm Hywel Thomas. I live in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland, 
but grew up in Maesteg, Wales. Since then I've spent most of my life living in Te Puna and Te Whanganui-a-tara (Wellington).
</p>
<p>A few values that are important to me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>empathy</li>
    <li>curiosity</li>
    <li>passion</li>
    <li>conservation & kaitiakitanga (stewardship of the natural environment)</li>
    <li>autonomy & self-determination</li>
    <li>honesty & openness</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I studied Ecology as an undergrad, and have worked since then as a science technician. This allowed me to focus my energies on causes I'm passionate about. I spent my high school and uni years working in hospitality, which was a great way to learn social lessons and helped me develop skill with empathy, teamwork and managing difficult situations.
</p>
<h2>Ethics & decision making</h2>
<p>While working in hospitality I was confronted by ethical decisions quite frequently. I mostly worked in licensed venues so I was always 
aware of the issues around alcohol and social behaviour. On more than one occasion I was able to notice inappropriate behaviour by patrons towards others.</p>
<p> The most effective solution we came to was to team up with another staff member - one would distract the intruding party while the other would check in on the others. This gave us an idea what was goin on from both sides, and give people a bit of space and ability to express discomfort if they felt it. Hopefully being vigilant and socially aware allowed us to remove people from a negative experience quickly and without judgement.
</p>

<h2> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
<p>I grew up in South Wales and attended school in Welsh (Cymraeg).
I grew up around a large extended family, and was partly raised by my grandparents, which was a pretty typical aspect of our culture. Both sides were families with a strong matriarch who had strong family values and sense of community and care.</p>
<p>Moving to NZ was difficult and I found it hard to adjust to some of the cultural differences between Welsh and Pākehā society of which I was now a part. It was something mostly intangible, but I remember feeling quite alienated at the time.
</p>
<p>Since that time I've grown to love Aotearoa, have a pretty convincing kiwi accent and have been proud to call this my home for the past 20 years.</p>
<p>I value self-improvement, and find I'm at my most satisfied when I have time to dedicate to this, or incorporate into other areas of my life.</p>
<p>I still occasionally get to practice Welsh - with my brother if we need to have secret-public conversations...
<p><em>Iechyd da pawb, a pob lwc i chi gyd.</em></p>
</p>
<h2>Personality testing</h2>
<p>
On the DOPE 4 bird test I was the Owl (35%) and Dove (30%). According to the Meyer Briggs test I'm an INFP (mediator). I probably sit somewhere between INFP-A and INFP-T type.
</p>
<h2>Strengths & Limitations</h2>
Some strengths I've been able to identify:
<ul>
<li>I'm compassionate and tend to be alert to how others are feeling in social situations.</li>
<li>I enjoy working on both technical and creative projects.</li>
<li>I can focus intently when I'm enjoying tasks and gaining insight (problem solving). I like to be thorough, patient and I'm undeterred by roadbloacks.</li>
<li>I work well with others - I don't mind playing the role of mediator and enjoy being able to make people feel comfortable.</li>
<li>I'm comfortable with communicating honestly and openly.</li>
<li>I'm adaptable and value flexibiliity.</li>
</ul>
Some limitations I can see:
<ul>
<li>I sometimes get a little bogged down in the details. I find I work best if I can actively manage workloads and keep tabs on where and how I need to achieve something.</li>
<li>I can let my mood make me less communicative - I deal well with stress, but can become a little subdued when in uncomfortable situations.</li>
<li>I can get excited about and start a lot of projects but don't always see them through to completion. Some element of this is good - as experimentation and exploration, but I benefit from oversight or mindfulness of this trait.</li>
<li>My mindset can sometimes wander over the line from self-criticism into pessimism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that my curiosity and passion are the biggest assets to my personal development. These are things that intrisically drive me.
I've also learned a lot of skills that have helped along the way. 
Empathy, flexibility and honesty have been skills I've acquired through reflection, reasoning and behavioural change - all due to social learning opportunities. 
</p>
<p>I'm quite creatively driven but also love technical challenges and like to be able to reason through problems to get to a solution.
I think my patience and ability to reason will help me to find ways to unblock myself or seek new ways to approach a problem.
</p>
<h2>Dealing with resistance/challenges</h2>
<p>When working as a fisheries observer I had to spend 4-6 weeks at sea on a contract, sometimes on vessels with very few english speakers aboard. It was often quite difficult to assert clearly what was required for me to effectively and safely do my job aboard. At times there could be resistance and tense conversations. 
</p>
<p>I distinctly remember one argument between two officers that I was present for involved a smashed espresso maker (which the slightly unstable crew member eventually threw overboard in another argument with someone else). I was able to keep my cool and try to eventually resolve the situation.
</p>
<p>In these situations I learned it's good to be able to remain level headed and try to understand why a conflict occurs. Being able to rationally understand what motivates action in people has been incredibly helpful to me in working with others.
