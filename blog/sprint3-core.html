<h1>Emotional Entelligence</h1> 
<h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Emotional Intelligence (or quotient - EQ) is a set of skills in our perception and processing of social and emotional information. We can break this down into four major skillsets or abilities <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-7-habits-of-emotionally-intelligent-people-2795431">(read more)</a>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceiving emotions.</li>
<li>Reasoning with emotions.</li>
<li>Understanding emotions.</li>
<li>Managing emotions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The general consensus is that 'intelligence' is a complex, broad concept that cannot be measured with a single empirical test for a specific set of traits or abilities. EQ looks more closely at our social skills, ability to manage and regulate emotions, and how we empathise with others.  
</p>

<h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
<p>General measures of intellectual ability usually revolve around empirical measures of an individuals ability to <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/theories-of-intelligence-2795035">Learn, Recognize problems and solve them.<a>.</p>
<p>IQ tests tend to measure thetestakers abilities using logic, reasoning, problem-solving and planning. There has been debate over the level of cultural bias and narrow focus of such testing, and it's relevance to the future success of test subjects.</p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ) seeks to recognize abilities not traditionally considered by general measures of IQ, and focus more on our abilities to understand our emotions and those of others.</p>
<p>This EI skillset could be broken down into <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/components-of-emotional-intelligence-2795438">5 categories:</a>
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> - Ability to understand and recognize own emotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Regulation</strong> - Ability to regulate when and how we express these emotions <em>appropriately</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Skills</strong> - Ability to interact well with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - Ability to understand how others are feeling, and your response to this.</li>
    <li><strong>Motivation</strong> - Ability to align motivation with internal reward, beyond fame/money/recognition.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Contemporary research has shown that EQ may <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316816644_A_time-lagged_study_of_emotional_intelligence_and_salary">even be a significant factor in determining professional success.</a></p>
<p>While the traditional model of IQ testing gave great weight to intellectual or academic ability, EQ can tell us a great deal of a persons ability to succeed and gain personal fulfillment.</p>
<p>A holistic approach to measuring intelligence should always include consideration of EQ based skills.</p>
