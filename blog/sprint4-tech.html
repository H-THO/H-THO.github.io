            <h2>Get Blocked</h2>
            <p>
            Sometimes getting blocked is unavoidable. It can be helpful to have a number of techniques or approaches to working through problems like this.
            </p>
            <p>
            On sprint 4 I was blocked initially in the gradebook kata. I was unable to see how I was supposed to assign the scores correctly to the students within the gradebook.
            I had tried a number of things already - I'd taken the problem and broken it down into steps and expressed this in pseudocode. 
            The main issue was in my proposed method to solve the issue - I had sort of misunderstood that there were much simpler ways to solve it. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My method was to assign the students by looping through the students, assigning the student objects to the gradebook, and then tried to add the scores to the students, while still in the for loop.
            To me coming from some use of Python - I figured I should be able to assign the scores using something like pythons dict(zip()), and of course doing so all within one loop would be the most 'elegant' way of solving the problem.
            I tried researching analogues of the dict(zip()) function implemented in javascript, which would've taken about 15 more lines of code. 
            It also feels a bit hacky to work like this - not writing as the language of choice would dictate the style and methods for a solution. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I tried to force a solution, trying to explain via <em>Rubber Duck</em> this way but came up with nothing - I couldn't access the students using index notation as they were objects (e.g. keys aren't indexed as in an array).
            I was getting frustrated at this point, so i took a break to stretch and have a coffee. At this point I decided I'd try to find a different method of solution. 
            After looking at the instructions again, I clicked.
            </p>
            <p> I wasn't required to do this all in one step, in fact I didn't have to use such a complex method to assign the student objects <em>or</em> the scores!
            Once I realised this, I was able to assing them all correctly by just using object literal notation and accessing array indexes statically from here.
            This was a question that was quite simple, but I'd managed to decide it was really difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sometimes it can be really helpful to step back out of a problem, reassess needs, and think a bit more laterally about how to solve it. 
            It was like my brain had gotten 'stuck' on one narrow possibility.
            </p>

            <h2>Elegant Solutions?</h2>
            <p>
            Sometimes, we're "lucky" and a solution pops straight out to us. I would't call this that <em>elegant</em>, but I can't say that many <em>elegant</em> solutions came to me during the sprint 4 Kata.
            </p>
            In the Super Fizzbuzz kata, I wrote pseudocode to solve the problem, identifying 3 cases - where we would alter the array value to a string. When the number was: 
            <ol>
                <li>A factor of 3</li>
                <li>A factor of 5</li>
                <li>A factor of both 3 and 5</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            I could see that condition 3 was actually just both conditions 1 and 2. It then hit me I could this using only two conditionals and working with a placeholder 'answer' string.
            See the code below:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                        function super_fizzbuzz (arr) {
                            for (i=0; i < arr.length; i++){
                              fzbz = ""
                              if (arr[i] % 3 === 0){fzbz+="Fizz"}
                              if (arr[i] % 5 === 0){fzbz+="Buzz"} 
                              if (fzbz.length > 0){arr[i] = fzbz}
                            }
                          return arr
                        }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
            The process of solving that felt mostly unconcious and managed it way under the timebox allocation for the problem. I knew there were solutions for similar fizzbuzz challenges online but I wanted to have a go at it myself first.
            I'd knew I'd actually done a fizzbuzz challenge when doing a python codeacademy course a few years ago, so I was able to understand generally how I might solve the problem
            </p>
            <p>
            I knew I had to use the modulo operator (%), so I read the docs on it and used the <em>Rubber Duck</em> method to understand how I'd implement the pseudocode. 
            It felt quite seemless to solve in this way, and I managed to come up with a solution I thought was fairly elegant. 
            It still felt a little cheaty as I had come across fizzbuzz before. 
            I did have a lot more blocks on the later challenges though, I think I was definitely a bit "lucky" here.
            </p>

        <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving</h2>
            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>Pseudocode has been incredibly useful - it's the link between breaking down your problem and actually implementing in code. I feel quite confident using it to intiially block out flow, then break it down into individual functions.</p>
            <h3>Trying something</h3>
            <p>This is sort of the step that comes after pseudocode - you need to have an idea first to then try it out. I find StackExchange questionsuseful for this part - the biggest issue being how to search for something relevant to what you need.</p>
            <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
            <p>This can be really useful if you need to understand exactly what your code is doing - I find it especially useful if I've just opened some code I'd been working on previously and need to get up to speed. I find it helpful to do if I've "borrowed" some code off the docs/stackExchange etc, to properly understand the flow.</p>
            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
            <p>This can be really helpful as it shows us exactly (sometimes) what has gone wrong in our code. Being able to quickly tell if the issue you have is with a typo in a variable name or a array index out of range is really useful.</p>
            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
            <p>Logging is very useful when you need to debug - you can log a variable state at different points in the program flow to read where your code might be off.</p>
            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>Using web searches has been useful to me at all points during a problem solving task - can help find initial ideas on how to achieve something, to seeing what different errors mean.</p>
            <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
            <p>Can be helpful to get clarification, or to use a real person as a rubber duck that can reply.</p>
            <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
            <p>I would likely only go to this if I was unable to unblock myself after a few attempts, during bootcamp.</p>
            <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
            <p>This has been quite helpful in showing me where I might be able to improve how I solve problems. Making ourselves mindful of weaknesses or seeing how far our ability can stretch can be really powerful and I think has helped me with more lateral thinking tasks.</p>
