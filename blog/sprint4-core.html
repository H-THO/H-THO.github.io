            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <h2>Understanding Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>
            <em>Neuroplasticity</em> refers to the ability of the brain to make new neural connections. 
            More traditional ways of thinking about ability and intelligence revolved around a the idea of a fixed or static intelligence and ability to learn.
            </p>
            <p>The current paradigm acknowledges that the human brain's neuroplasticity allows people to aquire new skills and recover from injuries - 
            it also allows us to leverage existing pathways in the process of learning and skill practice.</p>
            <h2>Increasing Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>
            If we acknowledge that our brains work like this, we can more meaningfully engage with learning material and the practice of new skills - realising these are the keys to retaining new knowledge and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is almost a skill in itself that we can train. By allowing our brain to reinforce pathways by repeated training we can gain motivation, as we can see mastery of a new skill slowly accruing.

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>What is the growth mindset?</h2>
        <p>
        Growth mindset can be characterised as the ability to understand our brains plasticity and actively employ it in our learning. It acknowledges the basis of our learning is contingent not only on this plasticity, but of our beleif in this capacity, and using this as a tool of motivation.
        </p>
        <p>I'd previously been reading about the growth mindset from the sprint 1 core tasks, and found it particularly interesting. As someone who can get demotivated by roadblocks, it was quite powerful to realise that a good marker to look at in my learning, was not how often I got stuck, but that I could see progress in my abilities solving problems & unblocking myself.</p>
        <p>
        It can really be useful to see that we have this capacity, and that the regular practice of these skills (and challenging ourselves) is what reinforces and grows our aquisition and mastery.

        <h2>Growth Mindset and our learning plan</h2>
        <p>
        Growth mindset, and the acknowledgement of our ability to train our brain and harness these <em>neuroplastic techniques</em> will be useful to us in making our learning plan dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
        If we are mindful our learning journey we will be able to take a step back and see where we are at in terms of skills progress, and actively reassess and edit our learning plan. It will also be crucial to ensure we are able to perform at our optimal level during the bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I see that developing a midnfullness of our core skills will be useful in ensuring we practice healthy habits for ourselves (eating, sleep and routine), and also ones that enable us to harness the growth mindset - by reflecting at the start and end of the day with the 2 questions, by actively addressing shortcomings (why do i procrastinate/be a perfectionist etc), and by reinforcing this self-communication loop with confirmation of our progress.
