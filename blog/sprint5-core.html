<h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>1. I enjoy challenges but I'm still capable of procrastinating when I care about something or I'm find a decision difficult.</li>
  <li>2. I can be overly pessimistic/self-critical at times.</li>
  <li>3. I am motivated by curiosity and enjoy the process of learning new skills.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
<p>
Understanding our values, empathy and self-awareness allows us to unbderstand our modes of learning and what drives us. It allow us to more effectively communicate with others - and gain insight into what emotional factors may be involved in how we do this.
</p>

<h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
<p>
Probably how much focus has been on insight into our own ways of learning, and how we can use that understanding to guide our path along through the learning material, and in what we want from working in tech.
</p>

<h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  Probably the writing focus - I enjoy the difference of the core and tech sections, though for me personally I find my ability to write well is much more variable and related to how I feel at the time, whereas tech work seems to me to be something far easier to jump into and get started on.
  Reflection can be a more intellectually draining task in some ways than the tech challenge work at times.
</p>

<h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
<p>
Because a holistic approach to preparing us for work in the tech industry should focus on core skills - our ability to understand social and emotional cues from others, identify our own motivators and demotivators, dealing with conflict. All these skills will be as useful in our careers as the languages we can write.
</p>

<h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
<p>
I don't think so. I think with the core material alongside the tech material, the focus on training us became much more well-rounded. The early focus on learning, plasticity, habit formation etc were crucial and made things in the foundations tech work much easier for me (or at least to idenitfy my motivation and get started!)
